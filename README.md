Part of the [unpins](https://unpins.org) project — native single-binary builds with no third-party runtime dependencies.

## Installation

Install with [unpin](https://github.com/unpins/unpin):

```bash
unpin less
```

Or run without installing:

```bash
unpin run less
```

## Build locally

```bash
nix build github:unpins/less
./result/bin/less
```

Or run directly:

```bash
nix run github:unpins/less
```

The first invocation will offer to add the [unpins.cachix.org](https://unpins.cachix.org) substituter so most pulls come pre-built.

## Manual download

The [Releases](https://github.com/unpins/less/releases) page has standalone binaries for manual download.
